# Car-Price-Prediction-Regression-Project
Car Price Prediction Project using Python: Analyzing Factors Influencing Car Prices

In this project, we aimed to help a Chinese automobile company, Geely Auto, understand the factors that influence car prices in the US market. Using Linear, Lasso, and Logistic regression techniques in Python, we built a predictive model to estimate car prices based on various independent variables.

Our project involved extensive data analysis and preprocessing, exploring the relationship between the car price and factors such as engine specifications, mileage, brand, and more. We evaluated the significance of these variables in predicting car prices and assessed the model's performance using relevant evaluation metrics.

By successfully modeling car prices, we provided valuable insights to Geely Auto's management, enabling them to understand the pricing dynamics and make informed decisions regarding car design, business strategies, and market positioning in the US market. This project served as a powerful tool for understanding and manipulating the pricing dynamics in a new market.
